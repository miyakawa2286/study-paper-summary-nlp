## どんなもの?
- Despite the widespread use of pre-training models for NLP applications, they almost exclusively focus on text-level manipulation, while **neglecting layout and style information** that is vital for document image understanding.
- In this paper, we propose the **LayoutLM** to jointly model **interactions between text and layout information** across scanned document images, which is beneficial for a great number of real-world document image understanding tasks such as information extraction from scanned documents.
- Furthermore, we also leverage image features to incorporate words’ visual information into LayoutLM.
- To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that text and layout are jointly learned in a single framework for documentlevel pre-training.
